TEMPLATES:
Templates were based on a codebook from an existing REDCap project. The structure
was kept and the variables names were changed. We also selected only some
common forms such as demographics, contact information, PHQ9 and GAD7. These
templates were not meant to be reprodusable. They follow the REDCap typical
codecook structure. Thus researchers have a starting point and can continue to
personalize their project as desired.
